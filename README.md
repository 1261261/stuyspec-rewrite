This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Set up the dotenv:
Create a .env.local file with `MONGODB_URI={MongoDB srv uri}`

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stuyspec/stuyspec-rewrite.git
```

2. Install all dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

3. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page hot reloads as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/articles](http://localhost:3000/api/articles). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/articles/index.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
